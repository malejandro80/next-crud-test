run

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

### explanation

next has the lastest react version (19). I worked with react bootstrap as a UI library, to ensure they won't have dependency issues, we need to run the flag --legacy-peer-deps

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
```
